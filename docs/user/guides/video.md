# Video

Kite can show a live video feed alongside (or behind) the map — a **local capture device** such as a
webcam or USB capture card, or an **RTSP stream** from a network video source. Open it from the
**Video** tool on the navigation rail.

## Choosing a source

Pick the **source kind** from the dropdown, set it up, then **Start** / **Stop** the feed. Your choice
is remembered between sessions.

- **Camera (device)** — a local capture device opened the simple way, through the system's built-in
  camera access. Choose a device from the dropdown (webcams and capture cards the system exposes are
  listed automatically). No extra downloads.
- **Native Capture (Advanced)** — a local capture device opened via Kite's capture engine for **more
  control and wider device support**. See the comparison below.
- **RTSP (network)** — enter the stream URL (e.g. from your video receiver or an RTSP server), pick a
  **transport**, and optionally **save the connection** to a list for one-click recall — see
  **[RTSP connections](#rtsp-connections-transport-and-auto-reconnect)** below.

!!! info "Supported RTSP video codecs: H.264 and MJPEG"
    Those two are what Kite officially supports and tests over RTSP today. **H.264** is the usual
    choice and works everywhere. **MJPEG** costs more bandwidth but is passed through untouched — on
    Linux that makes it the lightest option by a wide margin (see the
    [platform notes](#platform-notes-what-to-expect-per-operating-system)).

    Other codecs — **HEVC/H.265**, VP8, VP9, AV1 — are **not supported**. Some may happen to work on
    some systems, but none is tested, and a stream Kite cannot play usually shows up as an endless
    *"Reconnecting…"* rather than a clear error. If you need one of them, please open a request: the
    limit is that we have no way to test it, not that it is impossible.

### Camera (device) vs Native Capture — which should I use?

Both play a local capture device; they differ in **how** they open it.

| | **Camera (device)** | **Native Capture (Advanced)** |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Nothing to install | Needs the **ffmpeg** helper (downloaded automatically) |
| Device list | What the system exposes to apps | Read directly from the capture hardware — **can find devices the Camera list doesn't show** (e.g. some USB HDMI capture dongles) |
| Resolution / frame rate | A **request** — Auto / 720p / 1080p and an optional 30 / 60 fps wish; the camera picks the closest mode it supports | **Device-verified** — only the resolutions and frame rates your device actually reports (from a curated FPV set: SD PAL/NTSC, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p) |
| Codec | Chosen automatically | Chosen automatically to hit the selected resolution/frame rate |

**Start with Camera (device).** Switch to **Native Capture (Advanced)** if your device isn't listed
under Camera, or when you want to pin an exact resolution / frame rate that the device confirms it
supports. Both deliver the same smooth, hardware-accelerated picture for devices the system can open;
Native additionally reaches devices that only the capture engine can see.

### Resolution, frame rate and mirror

- **Resolution** — Camera offers Auto / 480p / 720p / 1080p; Native offers the device-verified list.
- **Format** (Native only) — the capture format the device reports, e.g. MJPEG or a raw one. **MJPEG is
  the efficient choice**: the picture is passed straight through with no conversion at all.
- **Frame rate** — Camera offers Auto / 30 / 60 fps; Native offers the frame rates the device reports
  for the chosen resolution and format.
- **Mirror** — flip the image horizontally (handy for front-facing cameras). Applies to every place the
  feed is shown.
- **Disable hardware acceleration** — force the CPU for any stream conversion. Only needed if the
  picture is broken or unstable with hardware acceleration; the setting is remembered.

While a feed is live the panel names the pipeline underneath the picture, with two labels:
**Transcode** (`Copy` = nothing is converted · `Hardware` · `Software`) and **Surface** (how the
picture reaches the screen). `Copy` is the cheapest possible case.

### RTSP connections, transport and auto-reconnect

The RTSP source has a small **connection manager** built in:

- **Direct connect** — type the `rtsp://…` URL and press Start. Next to the URL sits the **transport**
  selector:
    - **Auto** (default) — tries the engine's native reader first, then the ffmpeg fallback. Right for
      most sources.
    - **UDP** — lowest latency; **required for UDP-only servers** (some FPV / air-unit streamers). Uses
      the ffmpeg helper.
    - **TCP** — for sources that only speak interleaved TCP, or when UDP is blocked by the network.
- **Save it** — the **💾 button** stores the current URL + transport as a named entry (named after the
  host; rename it via ✎). Connections are **only saved when you press the button** — never
  automatically.
- **The list** — each saved connection is a one-line entry: **click it to load and connect**, ✎ edits
  name / URL / transport inline, ✕ removes it. The entry matching the current URL is highlighted.

**Auto-reconnect:** if a running RTSP feed drops or stalls — a radio hole on a cellular link, the
source restarting, a network change — Kite **reconnects automatically and keeps trying indefinitely**
until the feed returns or you stop it. While it retries, every video surface shows a
**"Reconnecting… (n)"** overlay with the attempt count and a **Stop** button. Brief dropouts on a live
feed are given a few seconds to heal on their own before a full reconnect is forced, so momentary
signal dips don't interrupt the stream unnecessarily.

!!! note "Helpers download themselves"
    **Camera (device)** needs nothing extra. **Native Capture** uses the bundled **ffmpeg** engine.
    **RTSP** uses **go2rtc** for the direct video path and **ffmpeg** for the image path — a machine
    whose browser engine offers no direct path (common on Linux) uses ffmpeg alone and never needs
    go2rtc. Kite downloads whichever it needs **automatically** the first time you use that source — no
    manual install. On macOS these are shipped with the app.

## Where the video shows

The same feed can appear in several places at once (they all share one stream):

- **In the panel** — a preview right in the Video panel.
- **As a widget** — the **Video** widget in a dock, sized to the stream's aspect ratio.
- **In a floating window** — a movable video frame over the map. **Drag the video body** to move it;
  dragging it to the **bottom-left corner snaps it there**, where it **displaces the bottom widget dock**
  to make room (the dock shrinks by the window's size). Drag it away from the corner to un-snap and
  free-float. The **top-right corner grip resizes** it (aspect-locked, touch-friendly).
- **In a detached window** (**Windows only** — see the [platform notes](#platform-notes-what-to-expect-per-operating-system);
  the button is simply absent elsewhere) — a separate, free-floating **OS window** you can place anywhere,
  including **outside the app** or on a second monitor. Opened from the Video panel; because it lives outside the
  app it's closed from the OS (not from inside Kite), and — unlike the floating window — it **can't host
  the map** (no swap). It's also the **lightest** option: the OS draws it directly, so on low-power
  systems using only the detached window keeps GPU load to a minimum.

## Map ↔ video swap

**Double-click a video surface** (the Video widget or the floating window) to **swap it with the map**:
the map jumps *into* the surface you clicked and the video moves out to the full-screen background — so
you get **video as your main view with the map in the small frame**. Double-click again to send the map
back to the full-screen background.

How interactive the swapped-in **mini-map** is depends on where it landed:

- **In the widget** — deliberately limited by space: **2D only** and **heading-follow only**, but you
  **can zoom**.
- **In the floating window** — fully interactive: pan and zoom normally (left-drag / single-touch). To
  **move the floating frame itself** while it holds the map, drag with the **right mouse button**
  (desktop) or **two fingers** (touchscreen).

## Platform notes: what to expect per operating system

Video is the one part of Kite that depends heavily on components Kite does **not** ship: the operating
system's built-in browser engine and its media plugins. That works out very differently per platform,
and it is only fair to say so plainly.

**Windows and macOS are the more predictable hosts for video.** Both ship a single, consistent media
stack, so a network stream is played directly by the system's hardware-accelerated decoder. If a smooth,
low-CPU, low-latency feed is important to you — and especially if you plan to fly with it — those are
the platforms we can most confidently recommend.

**On Linux, video support is provided as-is.** Kite runs in WebKitGTK there, which hands video playback
to GStreamer — and which plugins your distribution installs is entirely up to your distribution. There
are hundreds of combinations of distro, desktop, graphics driver and plugin set, and we cannot test or
support them all. Concretely, these are things Kite cannot fix from its side:

- **Whether an RTSP stream can be played directly at all.** Many Linux systems — Raspberry Pi OS and
  current Debian desktops among them — run a browser engine that does not expose the direct (WebRTC)
  video path, and that cannot be installed after the fact. Kite then falls back to a **converted image
  stream**. It works, but it adds a conversion, so **expect noticeably more latency than on Windows or
  macOS** — this is the single biggest practical difference. If a smaller delay matters more than
  resolution, **send a smaller or slower stream from the source** (e.g. 480p instead of 720p, or 30
  instead of 60 fps): that saves work at every stage at once.
- **How much each frame costs to put on screen.** The image path decodes every frame for display, and
  the Linux engine is markedly slower at that than the Windows one — measured on one laptop, the same
  720×576 frame took about 13 ms against roughly 2 ms, and longer while the machine was busy. So a
  frame rate that is effortless on Windows can be out of reach on comparable Linux hardware, whatever
  the CPU says.
- **Whether that conversion uses your graphics hardware.** Kite tests your machine at start-up and uses
  the GPU for the conversion when it can — on Intel and AMD desktop graphics via VAAPI, and on
  Raspberry Pi 3/4 class boards via their built-in decoder. Where that works it is a large saving
  (measured on an Intel laptop: roughly a seventh of the CPU load). But it depends entirely on your
  driver stack: **NVIDIA cards are not specifically covered**, and any machine whose test fails simply
  converts on the CPU instead. The Video panel names the path in use, and the diagnostic log records
  the verdict (see **[Video troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/video.md)**).
- **A camera that already delivers MJPEG is the best case on Linux.** Nothing is converted at all —
  the picture is passed through unchanged, which costs almost nothing and gives the lowest delay
  Linux can offer. If latency is your priority on Linux, prefer an MJPEG source. The Video panel shows
  **Transcode: Copy** when this applies.
- **You can force the CPU path.** If hardware conversion misbehaves on your machine, switch on
  **Disable hardware acceleration** in the Video panel; the setting is remembered.
- **Local camera quirks.** On Linux the system camera layer can be slow or unresponsive on some setups.
  Kite works around the worst cases (it caps the automatic resolution and frame rate, and routes the
  advanced capture path around that layer entirely), but a camera the system itself can't open cleanly
  is out of reach.
- **Picture-in-Picture** (the detached "Video Window") is a Windows-only feature — neither the Linux nor
  the macOS browser engine offers the interface Kite would need for it. All the in-app surfaces
  (panel, widget, floating window, full-screen swap) work everywhere.

None of this means Linux is unusable — a well-equipped desktop distribution generally plays video fine,
and it is a first-class platform for everything else Kite does. It only means that **if video is your
priority, Linux is the platform where you may have to do some work yourself**, and we can't promise a
particular result on a particular machine. In short: **Windows and macOS for maximum compatibility and
the lowest delay; on Linux, an MJPEG source is the setup that gets closest.**
