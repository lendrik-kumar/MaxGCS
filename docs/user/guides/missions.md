# Missions

Kite's mission planner lets you draw a flight plan on the map, send it to the aircraft, and read one
back. It speaks three flight stacks — **INAV**, **ArduPilot** and **PX4** — and adapts the editor,
the icons and the file format to whichever one is active. This guide covers the shared concepts and
where the three differ; it doesn't drill into every individual waypoint type.

Open the planner from the **Mission** tool on the navigation rail.

## Choosing the flight stack

The planner always targets one stack at a time:

- **Connected** — the stack is **locked** to the connected aircraft (INAV / ArduPilot / PX4), detected
  automatically. You can't switch it by hand while connected.
- **Offline** — pick the stack yourself with the INAV / ArduPilot / PX4 selector so you can plan before
  you fly. For **ArduPilot** there's also a **vehicle-type** dropdown (Plane / Copter / QuadPlane /
  Rover / Boat / Sub), which tunes the available commands and icons.

If you connect to a different stack while a plan is loaded, Kite asks before discarding it.

## The core idea: main waypoints vs modifiers

Whatever the stack, a mission is an ordered list of items that fall into two kinds:

- **Main waypoints** have a **position on the map** — fly here, hold here, land here.
- **Modifiers** have **no position of their own**. They change the sequence or behaviour at that point.

How each stack names them:

- **INAV** — main: *Waypoint*, *PosHold*, *Land*, *Set POI*; modifiers: *Jump* (loop back N times),
  *RTH* (return to home), *Set Heading*.
- **ArduPilot / PX4** — the items are MAVLink commands: the **navigation** commands (take-off, waypoint,
  loiter, land, RTL…) are the main steps, and **DO_ / CONDITION_** commands are the modifiers. Commands
  that don't apply to the selected vehicle type get a soft **⚠** warning — never blocked, just flagged.

The split is the same on all three, and it's what shapes the list and the map (below).

## How it's displayed

### In the waypoint list

- **Main waypoints** get a **numbered round badge** (1, 2, 3 …).
- **Modifiers** are shown **indented** under the point they follow. Their numbering depends on the
  stack: **INAV** leaves modifiers *unnumbered* (only main waypoints are counted), while **ArduPilot /
  PX4** number *every* item sequentially (modifiers included) — each matching how its flight controller
  counts mission items.
- A **Jump** is drawn as a repeat badge (**↺N**) linking back to its target.

### On the map

Waypoints appear as **numbered teardrop markers** joined by the route line, with type-specific icons
(loiter circles for holds, a take-off / land marker, a Set-POI/ROI eye, a home marker, and so on). The
numbers on the map match the list.

### Mission summary (footer)

Under the list a summary line shows the plan's **total distance** and **climb / descent**, plus — when
your waypoints set a cruise speed — an estimated **flight time**. (Without an explicit speed the time is
left out rather than guessed from an assumed cruise.) Next to it sit the waypoint count and the
provenance / **Modified** badges (below). This summary reads the same for INAV, ArduPilot and PX4.

### Numbering differs between stacks

This is the one difference worth remembering:

| Stack | Item 0 | Your waypoints |
|---|---|---|
| **INAV** | — | numbered **1 … N** (modifiers excluded from the count) |
| **ArduPilot** | **Home** — a fixed home slot, shown as a home marker, **not** an editable waypoint | start at **1** |
| **PX4** | no home slot — item 0 is already a real waypoint | numbered as the FC lists them |

So on an ArduPilot plan, "waypoint 1" is your first real point and the home item is managed for you (a
take-off is anchored on it). On PX4 there's no reserved home item at all.

## Altitudes

Each waypoint carries an altitude against a **reference**:

- **INAV** offers three modes: **REL** (relative to the home/launch point — the usual default), **AMSL**
  (absolute, above mean sea level) and **AGL** (above ground level / terrain-following). AGL is a
  **planning aid**: because INAV itself only stores REL/AMSL, Kite resolves each AGL point to an absolute
  altitude (using terrain elevation) when the mission is uploaded or exported.
- **ArduPilot / PX4** set a MAVLink **altitude frame** per item — **relative** (to home), **absolute**
  (AMSL) or **terrain** (terrain-following).

!!! tip "Check your clearance"
    The **Terrain** tool plots the ground beneath a planned route so you can sanity-check above-ground
    clearance before you fly. See it alongside the mission.

## Building a mission

- **Add** points by clicking on the map; **drag** a marker to move it; **reorder** in the list.
- **Edit** a point (type, altitude, parameters) from its popup or the list.
- **Multi-select** (while **editing**) to act on several waypoints at once:
    - In the **list**: **Ctrl/⌘-click** rows to toggle them, **Shift-click** for an inclusive range, or
      tap a number **badge** to toggle a single one.
    - On the **map**: **tap a marker** to toggle it in or out of the selection — no modifier key needed,
      so it works on touchscreens. Tapping empty map clears the selection.
    - With more than one selected, **right-click** (or long-press) a selected waypoint for **Batch
      Edit**: change the **altitude** and its **reference / frame** for the whole selection at once, and
      **attach an action** to every selected waypoint — an INAV **user-action** flag, or an
      ArduPilot / PX4 **`DO_` command** (speed change, camera trigger, servo, relay, …) — the same set
      as the single-waypoint editor's *Add modifier*. **Delete** the whole selection in one undoable step from the toolbar.
    - Works the same on **INAV, ArduPilot and PX4**.
- **Undo / redo** (**Ctrl+Z** / **Ctrl+Y**, or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** to redo) and **clear** are available
  while editing.
- **Survey patterns** — generate an area scan instead of placing every leg by hand (see
  [Survey patterns](#survey-patterns) below).

## Survey patterns

Instead of placing every leg by hand, the **Pattern Generator** fills an area with a flight pattern and
**appends** it to the current mission. Turn on **Edit** mode, then click **Pattern**, pick a shape,
position it on the map (drag the centre / corners / radius handle, or move the polygon vertices), set the
parameters, and press **Generate & Append**.

![The Pattern Generator panel and a shape on the map](../assets/guides/missions/pattern_generator.png)
/// caption
The Pattern Generator: pick a shape, shape it on the map, set spacing / altitude / actions, then Generate & Append.
///

| Shape | Pattern |
|---|---|
| **Rectangle** / **Polygon** | Back-and-forth zig-zag (lawn striping) across the area |
| **Rectangle Lawnmower** / **Polygon Lawnmower** | Concentric inward loops following the outline |
| **Circle** | Concentric rings, outer → inner |
| **Spiral** | A single inward spiral |

A concave polygon is handled automatically (the lawnmower splits it into convex pieces).

### Defining the area on the map

Most of the shaping happens directly on the map:

- **Move the whole pattern** — drag the **centre handle**.
- **Rectangle** — drag a **corner** to resize.
- **Circle / Spiral** — drag the **radius handle**.
- **Polygon** — drag a **yellow corner** to move a vertex; click a **grey midpoint** to **add** a vertex;
  to **remove** one, drag a corner onto the red **"Drop here to delete vertex"** banner or **right-click**
  it (a polygon keeps at least three corners). A self-intersecting shape snaps back.

The pattern settings **persist**, so you can move the shape and press **Generate & Append** again to drop
**another** copy elsewhere — each Generate appends to the current mission.

### Key parameters

- **Line spacing** — distance between adjacent legs (your camera footprint / desired overlap).
- **Altitude** and **Speed** — applied to every generated waypoint.
- **Orientation** — rotates the pattern; for zig-zags you can rotate the **scan lines** independently of
  the shape.
- **Turn distance** (line patterns) — extends each leg *beyond* the area so a fixed-wing aircraft has
  room to turn and line up before the next leg. This is the only part that deliberately reaches outside
  the area; the shape itself is never enlarged.
- **Stay inside area** (polygon) — **off**: the scan crosses gaps in a concave area as one continuous
  serpentine; **on**: it fills each connected sub-region without flying across the gaps.
- Pattern-specific: **Ring points** (circle / spiral), **direction / start corner** (lawnmower).

### Triggering actions along the pattern (cameras, servos, …)

How you fire a camera (or a servo / relay) along the pattern depends on the flight stack, because the
firmwares model it differently:

| | INAV | ArduPilot / PX4 |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | **User Action** flags **UA 1–4** — a per-waypoint bitmask you program on the FC | **Action waypoints** — real `DO_` mission items inserted into the sequence |
| **In the panel** | Tick UA 1–4 for each slot | Pick a command per slot from a dropdown |
| **Choices** | Whatever you've mapped UA 1–4 to in INAV | **Camera Auto-Trigger**, **Take Photo**, **Aux Function**, **Set / Repeat Servo**, **Set / Repeat Relay** (PX4: its supported subset) |

The **slots** are the same idea on both: **Line Start** / **Line End** for the zig-zag shapes (e.g. start
the camera at the beginning of each scan leg, stop it at the end), and **Start** / **Track** / **End**
for the loop / ring / spiral shapes (first waypoint / every waypoint / last waypoint).

!!! tip "Mapping run on ArduPilot / PX4"
    Set **Line Start → Camera Auto-Trigger** with your trigger distance, and **Line End → Camera
    Auto-Trigger** with distance **0** (stop). The camera then fires along each leg and is off during the
    turns and any gap.

### While the generator is open

The existing mission stays **visible but non-interactive** — you can see it to plan where the pattern
attaches, but its waypoints can't be dragged or edited until you leave the generator (the same on all
three stacks). Generating **appends** the pattern as a **single undo step**, so one **Ctrl+Z** removes
the whole pattern. On INAV the 120-waypoint limit is checked, with the option to truncate.

## Sending it to the aircraft

| Action | INAV | ArduPilot / PX4 |
|---|---|---|
| **Upload** (GCS → FC) | over MSP | over MAVLink |
| **Download** (FC → GCS) | over MSP | over MAVLink |
| **Save to FC permanently** | **EEPROM save / load** (survives a power cycle) | — (the FC keeps the uploaded mission) |

Up- and downloads show an **"x of n"** progress counter as the waypoints transfer.

After a download the plan is tagged **FC** (see provenance below); the mission you see is exactly what
the aircraft will fly.

## Files & the mission library

- **Save / load files** — INAV uses `.mission` (MultiWii XML); ArduPilot and PX4 use `.waypoints`
  (the QGroundControl-compatible plain-text format). You can also drag a file onto the map.
- **Provenance badges** tell you where the loaded plan came from — **FC** (downloaded), **FILE** (opened
  from disk) or **DB** (from the library) — plus a **Modified** badge once you've edited it. Shown for
  all three stacks.

### The mission library (Mission Manager)

Save a plan into Kite's **library** to reuse it across sessions, then open the **Mission Manager** to
browse them. Missions are grouped by **location** (named automatically from their coordinates) and can
be **searched**, **loaded to the map**, **exported** to a file, or **deleted** — with a warning when
flights still link to a mission you're removing. Saving **de-duplicates by content**, so re-saving an
unchanged plan won't pile up copies. The library is **shared across the flight stacks** (each mission
loads back into the stack it belongs to), and library missions also link to flights in the
**[logbook](logbook.md)**.

## Multiple missions (INAV)

INAV lets you keep **several missions** (up to nine) and switch between them with the mission tabs —
handy for storing alternates. Uploading sends **all** of them to the flight controller as one combined
mission set (and **EEPROM save** stores the whole set); downloading reads it back and splits it into the
separate tabs again — so a multi-mission round-trips cleanly. ArduPilot and PX4 work with a **single**
mission.

## Staying clear of airspace

If the aircraft has **geozones** (INAV) or a **geofence** (ArduPilot / PX4) set, Kite can check your
plan against them and warn about waypoints that breach a no-fly area. See **[Safety](safety.md)**.
